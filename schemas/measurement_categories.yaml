# This file defines the taxonomy of measurement categories for HCI dependent variables.
# Each category specifies aggregation strategies, unit conversion factors, and known instruments.

version: "1.0"

categories:
  Time:
    description: "Duration or latency measurements"
    scale_type: ratio
    default_unit: seconds
    allowed_units: [s, ms, min, hours]
    aggregation: mean
    conversion_factors:
      ms: 0.001    # to seconds
      min: 60      # to seconds
      hours: 3600  # to seconds
    notes: "Report central tendency and dispersion; convert to common unit for aggregation"

  Accuracy:
    description: "Correctness and error measurements"
    scale_type: ratio
    default_unit: percentage
    allowed_units: [percentage, proportion, rate]
    aggregation: weighted_mean
    conversion_factors:
      proportion: 100  # to percentage
    notes: "Distinguish between accuracy (correct) and error rate (incorrect)"

  Count:
    description: "Discrete occurrence counts"
    scale_type: ratio
    default_unit: integer
    allowed_units: [integer, frequency]

    notes: "May be normalized by time or trials for rate calculations"

  Likert:
    description: "Ordinal rating scales from standardized instruments"
    scale_type: ordinal
    default_unit: null  # varies by instrument
    aggregation: median
    notes: "Use median for ordinal data; mean acceptable for validated instruments with sufficient items"

    description: "Ratios and percentages"
    scale_type: ratio
    default_unit: percentage
    allowed_units: [percentage, proportion, ratio]
    aggregation: weighted_mean
    conversion_factors:
      proportion: 100  # to percentage
    notes: "Use logit or arcsine transformation for proportions near 0 or 1"

  Binary:
    description: "Dichotomous outcomes"
    scale_type: nominal
    default_unit: boolean
