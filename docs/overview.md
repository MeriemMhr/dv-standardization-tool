# Project Overview

## Title
Standardizing Reporting of Dependent Variables in HCI Research:
A Naming Scheme and Conversion Tool for Open Data

## Summary
This project addresses the persistent lack of standardization in how dependent variables (DVs) are reported in HCI empirical research. By developing a standardized naming convention and a supporting YAML-based conversion tool, we aim to enhance transparency, comparability, and interoperability across open datasets.

The initiative aligns with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting reusable data practices and reducing redundancy in scientific workflows.

## Objectives
- **Literature-driven schema**: Identify inconsistencies in DV naming through a structured literature review ([see `MSc_Coursework_Full_LiteratureReview_MeriemMehri.pdf`]).
- **Naming convention**: Develop a flexible but structured taxonomy for naming DVs.
- **Conversion tool**: Build a lightweight tool to transform diverse DV naming formats into a unified YAML schema.
- **Case study**: Demonstrate the interoperability potential of the tool via sample transformations.
- **Long-term impact**: Foster more reproducible and FAIR-aligned HCI research practices.

## Status [July 2025]
Currently in the prototyping phase; schema design complete and initial dataset mappings underway.
